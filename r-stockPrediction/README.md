A project which ranks prediction models using stock price prediction
=========

#Please keep in mind:

1. Run input/getStock.sh to generate the input CSV files
2. Install missing packages - e.g.    install.packages("forecast")
3. Run the code of OptionallyRunTest.r for a test (with the function findBestPrediction from findBestPrediction.r being in the workspace)

Disclaimer: The code for this project was built for the "Analytics" course however, you can use this script as a starting point to built your own project, but please go over the code for obvious improvements and cleanups first.
